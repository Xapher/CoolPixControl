Tip:<br/>
Please wait for "Negotiating..." prompt on the camera. This means the camera is set up, otherwise it will not work as it should.

Current Features:<br/>
&ensp;-Camera Connection<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Starts a session (The display on the camera will go to live view, however, it does not transmit the live view to the app yet)<br/>
&ensp;-Image and File Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Thumnail ID's Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Thumbnail Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Full Resolution Image Retrieval<br/>

Planned Features:<br/>
&ensp;-Camera Connection<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Full Control with live preview (Limited to take picture, zoom in, and zoom out)<br/>
&ensp;-Image and File Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Retrieve Image After Taking Picture From this<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Batch Download (All Images)<br/>



Issues:<br/>
&ensp;-Files can sometimes be named improperly while using the cameras ids<br/>
&ensp;-No real way to end the session on the camera, other than turning it off. I have to experiment more to find the correct usage of the code.
