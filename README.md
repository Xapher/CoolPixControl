# CoolPixControl
A Winforms application to control A Nikno coolpix camera from your pc (Currently works with L840 version, Unsure if it'll work with others)

<image></image>

Current Features:<br/>
&ensp;-Camera Connection<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Starts a session (The display will go to live view, however, it does not transmit the live view to the app yet)<br/>
&ensp;-Image and File Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Thumnail ID's Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Thumbnail Retrieval<br/>


Planned Features:<br/>
&ensp;-Camera Connection<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Full Control with live preview (Limited to take picture, zoom in, and zoo out)<br/>
&ensp;-Image and File Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Full Resolution Image Retrieval<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Retrieve Image After Taking Picture From APP<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-Full Download (All Images)<br/>



Issues:<br/>
&ensp;-Files can sometimes be named improperly from using the cameras ids<br/>
&ensp;-No real way to end the session, other than turning it off. I have to experiment more to find the correct usage of the code.
